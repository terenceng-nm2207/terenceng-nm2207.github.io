<h1><center>The Ultimate Guide to Renting in Singapore</h1></center>
<h5><center>by terence ng</center></h5>

<article class="intro" id="introID">
<center>Over the past year, Singapore has experienced a massive surge in rental rates,
  causing rental to be unaffordable to many. According to The Straits Times, HDB rents 
  went up by 28.5 perecent in 2022. In December 2022,  a HDB flat in Punggol was rented out 
  for $4000, causing an uproar among many Singaporeans <p>
  The rise in rent prices can be attributed to many factors, such as an increase in demand
  of rental properties because of the pandemic and the delay of supply of BTO flats by
  the government.

   <center> We hope that the above graphs give you a better understanding of the rental
      rates in Singapore so that you can consider what you can afford. As a general rule
      of thumb, we recommend spending approximately 30%-40% of your monthly income on
      rent. This gives elbow room for your other expenses like insurance, groceries and bills.
      Use our rent calculator to calculate the maximum amount you should spend on rent. <p>
